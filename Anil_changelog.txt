Changelog:
04/01/2017 - 04/02/2017

-Change line 50 removed hard coded value in condition and replaced with viewport height - bubble height

-Changes Line 51 in Bubble.java class. Changed velocity.y value to -1. Value of zero was conflicting with line 34.
	Value -1 causes bubble to bounce off cieling instead of "sticking" a bit to the top.

-Added score variable to the BubbleAdventrue.java file so that the score value can be passed for storage and display in all game states if needed.

-Score display now functional during gameplay

To Do:

-Add options in GameOverState to either return to main menu or 	play again.

-Display resulting score at GameOverState.
